Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) for Neuroimaging Data
 
Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) for identifying necessary (but not sufficient) conditions in data sets with discrete (with many values)  and continuous necessary conditions.
The ceiling line is estimated using ceiling regression with Free Disposal Hull (FDH) to obtain the "empty space" of the left upper corner.

If a negative slope is found for Y is found then the "empty space" of left 
lower corner is estimated by mirroring Y.

For a detailed introduction into NCA, see the comprehensive documentation at:
